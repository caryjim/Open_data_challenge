Open_data_challenge comprehensive notebooks 

I'm in a process of uploading R notebooks that I had for the Education Data Challenge. 
This will be an ongoing process as I'm re-running the codes and correcting any syntax issue. 

There are also extension based on the inital data collection in which the IMLS data
was used for a quick viz, as well as mapping Nex Mexico data for regions that is served by the LANL foundation.
